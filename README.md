# CoffeeChop

A simple but elegant AngularJS single page app suitable for small online shoppings. You can use CoffeeChop as a fancy front-end for your online shop, but you should implement your desired back-end for it to provide the necessary JSON feed and management of your website. 

You can change feeds url and parameters easily in /js/app.js file.

## Dependencies

  * Angular JS
  * Zurb Foundation
  * Slick JS (with slick-angular)
  * Jasmine-2.3.2 (for tests only)

## Quickstart

The project dependencies are not included in this repository. To install all the dependencies you will need bower. Run this command in the main directory.

```bash
bower install
```

## Sass

This project is written entirely with SCSS so you can easily re-configure it by editing _coffeechop.scss and _coffeechop_animations.scss files. Anyway for those less nerdy of you I provided the stylesheet folder so you won't need compass to use this project.

## Unit test

Unit test are available under tests directory and do not need bower to include dependencies.

The project is under active development and there is NO STABLE VERSION. Please use with your own risk and this kinda stuff!
